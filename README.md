Optionally use Adobe Illustrator Template files in 03_assets/ to generate content like Nav and Icon buttons. 

Copy the fnr.html file (one big comment) into your html file and use your favorite text editor to find and replace ALL occurences of the indicated values that you want to change. 

Manually update things like links, individual file locations for external resources, your custom utm tracking code, and other things. 

You're ready to use it.
